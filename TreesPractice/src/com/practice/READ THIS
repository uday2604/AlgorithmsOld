
1) Breadth First Search of a binary tree is similar to Level Order Traversal. This can be implemented with the help of a queue.
For Breadth first, add all children to queue, then pull the head and do breadth first search on it (Recursive way)

2) Depth First Search of a binary tree is more similar to Pre Order Traversal of the tree.
For Depth first search, add all children to stack, then pop and do the depth first search on that node using the same stack (Recursive way)
